# DING TEA BOT
## OBJECTIVE:
Create a bot that will use the small foot print and portability of the raspberry pi in order to
figure out how many people are in line at ding tea.  Then post the information to the discord channel
so that we can hang out in the bathroom and be aware of the store's business.
